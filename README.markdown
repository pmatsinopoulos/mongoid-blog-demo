# Blog Using MongoDB

This is a sample project to demonstrate the MongoDB integration with Rails, via the `mongoid` gem.

It covers what [Rails Casts Episode](http://railscasts.com/episodes/238-mongoid) covers, but it is updated for the latest versions:

* MongoDB:   version `3.2`
* `mongoid`: version `5.1`
* Rails:     version `4.2`
